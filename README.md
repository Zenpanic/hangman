Hello!

This is a simple Hangman game, made with Python. It's a little project I made to practice GUI creation and manipulation with tkinter. 

The final version should include an actual hangman getting drawn as the game progresses. It should also feature the possibility to import a list of words from a file or to import a random word through the internet. 

Enjoy!
